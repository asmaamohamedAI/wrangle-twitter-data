The purpose of this project is to put in practice what I learned in data wrangling 
data section from Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The dataset that is 
wrangled is  the  tweet  archive  of  Twitter  user @dog_rates,  also  known 
as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with 
a  humorous  comment  about  the  dog.  These  ratings  almost  always  have  a 
denominator of 10.

This report briefly describes my wrangling efforts.
